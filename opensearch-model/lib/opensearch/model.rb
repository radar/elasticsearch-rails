  # Elasticsearch integration for Ruby models
  # =========================================
  #
  # `OpenSearch::Model` contains modules for integrating the Elasticsearch search and analytical engine
  # with ActiveModel-based classes, or models, for the Ruby programming language.
  #
  # It facilitates importing your data into an index, automatically updating it when a record changes,
  # searching the specific index, setting up the index mapping or the model JSON serialization.
  #
  # When the `OpenSearch::Model` module is included in your class, it automatically extends it
  # with the functionality; see {OpenSearch::Model.included}. Most methods are available via
  # the `__elasticsearch__` class and instance method proxies.
  #
  # It is possible to include/extend the model with the corresponding
  # modules directly, if that is desired:
  #
  #     MyModel.__send__ :extend,  OpenSearch::Model::Client::ClassMethods
  #     MyModel.__send__ :include, OpenSearch::Model::Client::InstanceMethods
  #     MyModel.__send__ :extend,  OpenSearch::Model::Searching::ClassMethods
  #     # ...
  #
  module Model
    METHODS = [:search, :mapping, :mappings, :settings, :index_name, :document_type, :import]

    # Adds the `OpenSearch::Model` functionality to the including class.
    #
    # * Creates the `__elasticsearch__` class and instance method. These methods return a proxy object with
    #   other common methods defined on them.
    # * The module includes other modules with further functionality.
    # * Sets up delegation for common methods such as `import` and `search`.
    #
    # @example Include the module in the `Article` model definition
    #
    #     class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    #       include OpenSearch::Model
    #     end
    #
    # @example Inject the module into the `Article` model during run time
    #
    #     Article.__send__ :include, OpenSearch::Model
    #
    #
    def self.included(base)

      #     => #<Elasticsearch::Client:0x007f96a6dd0d80... >
      #
      # @note You have to set the client before you call Elasticsearch methods on the model,

      # @param options [Hash] Optional parameters to be passed to the Elasticsearch client
      #
